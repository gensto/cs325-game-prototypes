<h2>Dodge that rock!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li>
<li>Dodging rocks with a car</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>
<li>Having the ability to move around whilst dodging rocks</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li>
<li>I learned the various engine functions that are available in phaser. The hardest part was figuring out which function to apply to what I want to do</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Car image: <a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/2054/nioubiteul">Car</a></li>
<li>Rock image I had laying around in my PC</li>
<li>Road image I had laying around in my PC</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
</li>
<li>I'm not sure which other game resembles my game. I thought of this game off the top of my head. Perhaps there might be something similar out there</li>
<li>My code was just made by me and looking through documentation to figure out the various phaser functions to use</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>
<li>Take control of a car that must dodge various rocks that are laying on the road</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>
<li>Input is from the mouse pointer, where the car follows the location of the mouse pointer. Randomness is involved with the location of the rocks on the road. Genre would most likely be action. And play style is a top down view where you control player action with a mouse pointer</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>
<li>Being able to move the car based off mouse pointer location along with random spawning rocks</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>
<li>I would like them to experience hand eye coordination</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>
<li>You are suppose to move the car left and right, by moving your mouse pointer to either side of the car. You do this in order to dodge the incoming rocks that are spawning up the road. Each time you successfully dodge a rocket, you gain one point, however, if you get hit by the rock then you lose a life. And you start off with 3 lives.</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>
<li>Moving your car out of the way as soon as the rock spawns</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>
<li>The game is set on the road, and the characters are a car and a rock.</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>
<li>Taxi/Uber drivers, because this might be a good simulation of what they may expect on the road</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
<li>Depends how good you are at dodging rocks</li>

</ul>
